Goals complete! I've successfully translated the static layout & sample content
from my Express/PUG demo into React. The links don't work - the only
functionality is created via CSS. There are also a few pieces of the display
that are slightly buggy. But that's OK - they're all going to get either
re-written or removed soon.

#### Next steps:

1. Create navigation menu functions.
    1. Apply to topnav area
    2. Apply to sidebar area
    3. Apply to mainContent tabs
2. Create button creation functions.

The journey begins. 

While I'd love for this project to result in a polished, finished project,
the real objective is to learn and strengthen my web development skills,
including several "meta-skills".

Things I want to learn/improve in completing this project:
- Reactjs
- Bootstrap.css
- Markdown
- Unit testing
- Documenting my code
- Git best practices

#### Today's goals

1. ~~Create the Reactjs project environment~~
2. ~~Convert my static html into Reactjs format~~
