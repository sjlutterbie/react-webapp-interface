The journey begins. 

While I'd love for this project to result in a polished, finished project, the real objective is to learn and strengthen my web development skills, including several "meta-skills".

Things I want to learn/improve in completing this project:
- Reactjs
- Bootstrap.css
- Markdown
- Unit testing
- Documenting my code
- Git best practices

### Today's goals

1. Create the Reactjs project environment
2. Convert my static html into Reactjs format
